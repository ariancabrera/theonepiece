Hello Angelo,

Thanks for reaching out to HCP Support!

Thanks for your question, unfortunately at this moment TFC and HCP are two different systems, however we are working to unify our cloud services and products. Anyways an internal request has been submitted to have the HCP Engineering team review this. 

If you have been an assigned HashiCorp Customer Success Manager, they will be notified about this internal request and can continue to keep you updated as progress is made or you can reach out to them directly to inquire about a status update on the request.

You can also provide feedback directly using the [HCP Feedback Form] (https://hashicorp.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bOElUPCdFXaQOfr) and subscribe to the [HashiCorp Blog](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog) or also check out the [HCP Changelog](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/docs/changelog) to keep up with new feature updates.

If there are no more outstanding issues, questions, or concerns at this time, I will close this support ticket if everything has been addressed upon your acknowledgement. If there is anything else I can help out with related to this ticket, please let me know!
