Hello Steve,

This error usually occurs when there is a misconfigured Entity ID in Okta not matching the assigned Entity ID in HCP that is highlited [in this article](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/articles/5768317576339--Access-was-denied-while-authenticating-error-logging-into-HCP-via-SSO-)
