Hi Nikolay,
Thanks for reaching out to HCP Support!
One of the conditions for account deletion is that all resources have been destroyed. Can you please delete the active network resource (id: 
7dc9bd54-6ae3-490c-b75a-f67f17293504) associated with your organization?
Also, I just sent you a separate email to verify your identity. Please respond to that email confirming the request when you can. Once I've gotten you verified and all resources are destroyed, I'll go ahead and proceed with the account deletion process.
Please be aware that the following conditions must be met before your account can be deleted:
All other users have been deleted.
The email address of the owner must be the only remaining user in the HCP org.
All service principals have been deleted.
All resources (HVNs, clusters, packer registry) have been deleted.
Any outstanding balances have been paid.
Thanks,
